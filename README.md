# What is EDork?
The .edork file format is a secure way to distribute dorks. Only someone in possession of the EDork private key can decrypt your dorks once they are encypted into the EDork format. 

# How do you use dorks in the .edork format?
The following tools support the EDork format:
1. Mango Keywords
2. Cork Dork
  
# Why should you use .edork?
Many people purchase dorks, skid the formats, and never buy dorks from you again. EDork prevents this because your customer can never view the dorks.

# Who can decrypt my dorks?
The only people in possession of the EDork private key are the developers of tools which support EDork. Currently that is only SirChanChan.
